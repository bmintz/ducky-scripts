##Winlogon-backdoor

Creates a backdoor in winlogon that lets you open a cmd with system privileges in the logon screen.
It will auto-close after about 3 minutes, though.
Use Left Alt + Left Shift + Print Screen to open it.

As for which version to use, don't use v2 or v2-visible. They were my failed attempts at improving the script.
